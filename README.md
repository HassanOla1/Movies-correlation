# Data Analysis of Movie Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains R code for the analysis of a movie dataset. The dataset consists of various attributes of movies such as budget, gross revenue, release year, ratings, stars, genres, and countries. The goal of this analysis is to explore relationships between different variables and gain insights into factors that influence the success of movies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is provided in a CSV format and contains information on movies. It includes the following columns:

- `budget`: The budget of the movie.
- `gross`: The gross revenue generated by the movie.
- `released`: The release date of the movie.
- `rating`: The rating of the movie.
- `star`: The lead actor/actress of the movie.
- `genre`: The genre of the movie.
- `country`: The country where the movie was produced.

## Analysis Steps
The analysis is conducted in R programming language using various packages such as `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization. The following steps are performed in the analysis:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is loaded into R and cleaned to ensure data integrity. This includes converting data types, extracting relevant information, and removing duplicate entries.

2. **Summary Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum values are calculated for numerical variables like budget and gross revenue.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize relationships between variables. This includes scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and trends in the data.

4. **Visualization**: Visualizations are created to better understand the data and communicate findings effectively. This includes scatter plots to visualize the relationship between budget and gross revenue, box plots to compare gross earnings across different categorical variables, and correlation matrices to understand the relationship between numerical variables.

5. **Interpretation**: The results of the analysis are interpreted to draw meaningful insights and conclusions about factors influencing the success of movies. This includes identifying correlations between variables and understanding their implications.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the success of movies. By exploring relationships between variables such as budget, gross revenue, ratings, stars, genres, and countries, we gain a deeper understanding of the movie industry. These insights can be used by movie producers, directors, and investors to make informed decisions and improve the chances of success for future movie projects.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the analysis, dataset, and steps performed.
